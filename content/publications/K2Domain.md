description: "Porphyromonas gingivalis is an obligately anaerobic bacterium recognized as an agent of adult periodontitis. P. gingivalis produces cysteine proteinases called gingipains, proteases that break down both proteins and cytokines. The Lysine gingipain, or Kgp,  is the most potent fibrinogen/fibrin degrading enzyme of the 3 gingipains in human plasma and is involved in the bleeding tendency at the diseased gingiva."
